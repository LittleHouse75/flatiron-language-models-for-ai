    "# Experiment 3 — Frontier LLMs via OpenRouter API\n",
    "### Zero-Shot Dialogue Summarization with GPT, Claude, Gemini, and More\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This experiment completes our three-part investigation by testing **frontier large language models** on dialogue summarization—no training required, just inference via API.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Question**\n",
    "\n",
    "Experiments 1 and 2 showed what's possible with fine-tuned local models: the custom DistilBERT→DistilGPT2 architecture reached ROUGE-L 30.29, while purpose-built BART achieved 42.13. But what happens if we skip training entirely and just *ask* the most capable models in the world to summarize conversations?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the approach many teams try first in practice. Before investing in custom fine-tuning infrastructure, it's natural to wonder: *\"Can we just prompt GPT/Claude/Gemini and call it a day?\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Models**\n",
    "\n",
    "We evaluate five frontier models via the OpenRouter API, selected to span the major providers and price points:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Model | Provider | Parameters | Context | Input Cost | Output Cost |\n",
    "|-------|----------|------------|---------|------------|-------------|\n",
    "| **GPT-5 Mini** | OpenAI | Compact | 400K | $0.25/M | $2.00/M |\n",
    "| **Gemini 2.5 Flash** | Google | Workhorse | 1.05M | $0.30/M | $2.50/M |\n",
    "| **Claude 4.5 Haiku** | Anthropic | Fast | 200K | $1.00/M | $5.00/M |\n",
    "| **Qwen 2.5 72B** | Alibaba | 72B active | 33K | $0.07/M | $0.26/M |\n",
    "| **Kimi K2** | Moonshot AI | 1T total (32B active) | 262K | $0.39/M | $1.90/M |\n",
    "\n",
    "This selection includes:\n",
    "- **The \"big three\" frontier labs:** OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google\n",
    "- **Two strong Chinese models:** Qwen (open-weight) and Kimi K2 (trillion-parameter MoE)\n",
    "- **A 70× cost spread:** From Qwen at $0.07/M input to Claude at $1.00/M input\n",
    "\n",
    "The diversity lets us explore whether price correlates with summarization quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Matters**\n",
    "\n",
    "Zero-shot API models offer compelling advantages:\n",
    "- **No training required** — deploy immediately\n",
    "- **No GPU infrastructure** — runs anywhere with internet\n",
    "- **Always up-to-date** — models improve without your intervention\n",
    "- **Massive scale** — billions of parameters, trillions of training tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "But they also have costs:\n",
    "- **Per-query pricing** — every summary costs money\n",
    "- **Latency variability** — depends on provider load and geography\n",
    "- **Privacy concerns** — data leaves your infrastructure\n",
    "- **Less control** — you can't fine-tune for your domain\n",
    "\n",
    "This experiment measures whether the \"just use GPT\" approach actually works for dialogue summarization, and how it compares to the fine-tuned models from Experiments 1 and 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What This Notebook Covers**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Configuration and API client setup\n",
    "2. Loading the SAMSum test set (same 819 examples as Experiments 1 & 2)\n",
    "3. Zero-shot prompt construction\n",
    "4. Running API calls with caching and retry logic\n",
    "5. ROUGE evaluation on the held-out test set\n",
    "6. Latency analysis and qualitative examples\n",
    "7. Initial comparison to fine-tuned baselines\n",
    "\n",
    "The detailed cross-experiment analysis will follow in the final comparison notebook."

    "   - Kimi K2 is a trillion-parameter MoE from an emerging Chinese lab\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Does price predict quality?**\n",

    "\n",
    "4. **How do context windows and architecture choices affect summarization?**\n",

    "## 15. Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Surprise: Fine-Tuned Local Models Win on ROUGE\n",
    "\n",
    "The most striking finding from this experiment is that **zero-shot frontier models underperform our fine-tuned local baselines** on automatic metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Model | ROUGE-1 | ROUGE-2 | ROUGE-L | Type |\n",
    "|-------|---------|---------|---------|------|\n",
    "| **BART (Exp 2)** | **50.27** | **25.71** | **42.13** | Fine-tuned local |\n",
    "| T5 (Exp 2) | 47.43 | 22.92 | 39.08 | Fine-tuned local |\n",
    "| Gemini 2.5 Flash | 44.60 | 17.85 | 35.49 | Zero-shot API |\n",
    "| Qwen 2.5 72B | 44.15 | 17.31 | 35.17 | Zero-shot API |\n",
    "| Claude 4.5 Haiku | 43.62 | 16.55 | 34.58 | Zero-shot API |\n",
    "| DistilBERT→GPT2 (Exp 1) | 37.73 | 14.26 | 30.29 | Fine-tuned local |\n",
    "| Kimi K2 | 41.42 | 13.22 | 32.36 | Zero-shot API |\n",
    "| GPT-5 Mini | 41.56 | 14.34 | 32.15 | Zero-shot API |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key observation:** The best frontier model (Gemini 2.5 Flash at ROUGE-L 35.49) falls **6.64 points below** fine-tuned BART (42.13). Even our \"Frankenstein\" DistilBERT→DistilGPT2 model from Experiment 1 is competitive with GPT-5 Mini and Kimi K2.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why does this happen?** \n",
    "\n",
    "Zero-shot models optimize for *general helpfulness*, not SAMSum-style summaries specifically. They tend to:\n",
    "- Write longer, more elaborate summaries than SAMSum's terse 15–30 word references\n",
    "- Include contextual framing (\"The group decided...\", \"After discussion...\")\n",
    "- Occasionally add interpretive commentary\n",
    "\n",
    "Fine-tuned models, by contrast, learn exactly what SAMSum annotators considered a \"good\" summary—matching their length, style, and focus on outcomes over process.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Price vs. Performance: No Clear Winner\n",
    "\n",
    "One might expect that more expensive models produce better summaries. The data tells a different story:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Model | Input Cost | Output Cost | ROUGE-L | Rank |\n",
    "|-------|------------|-------------|---------|------|\n",
    "| **Qwen 2.5 72B** | **$0.07/M** | **$0.26/M** | **35.17** | **2nd** |\n",
    "| GPT-5 Mini | $0.25/M | $2.00/M | 32.15 | 5th |\n",
    "| Gemini 2.5 Flash | $0.30/M | $2.50/M | 35.49 | 1st |\n",
    "| Kimi K2 | $0.39/M | $1.90/M | 32.36 | 4th |\n",
    "| Claude 4.5 Haiku | $1.00/M | $5.00/M | 34.58 | 3rd |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key observations:**\n",
    "- **Qwen 2.5 72B** is the **cheapest** model ($0.07/M input) yet ranks **2nd** on ROUGE-L\n",
    "- **Claude 4.5 Haiku** is the **most expensive** (14× Qwen's input cost) yet ranks only **3rd**\n",
    "- **Gemini 2.5 Flash** offers the best ROUGE-L (35.49) at mid-tier pricing\n",
    "\n",
    "For dialogue summarization specifically, the open-weight Qwen model delivers near-frontier quality at a fraction of the cost. This challenges the assumption that \"bigger lab = better results.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Zero-Shot Summary Quality: Good but Verbose\n",
    "\n",
    "From the qualitative examples, frontier models produce **fluent, accurate summaries** that capture the main points. The issue is style mismatch, not comprehension.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1 (Test ID 432 — Tattoo Parlor):**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Source | Summary |\n",
    "|--------|---------|\n",
    "| **Human** | \"Javier was initially eager to have a tattoo done at Warsaw Ink but the price turned out to be too high. Javier decided to have a tattoo done in Colombia.\" |\n",
    "| **BART** | \"Javier will get a Warsaw ink tattoo back in colombia.\" |\n",
    "| **Gemini** | \"Javier asked Judie for English-speaking tattoo parlor recommendations. Judie suggested Warsaw Ink, but Javier decided against it due to the high price.\" |\n",
    "| **GPT-5 Mini** | \"Javier asks for English-speaking tattoo parlors; Judie recommends Warsaw Ink and says her girlfriend got a tattoo there for $1000, so Javier decides to get tattooed in Colombia instead.\" |\n",
    "\n",
    "The frontier models tell the *story* well—GPT-5 Mini even includes the price point ($1000) that explains Javier's decision. But ROUGE penalizes the extra words that don't appear in the reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2 (Test ID 86 — New Year's Eve Planning):**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Source | Summary |\n",
    "|--------|---------|\n",
    "| **Human** | \"Nathalie, Olafur and Zoe are planning the New Year's Eve. Nathalie wants something classy. Olafur doesn't like opera. They want to go to the Breakfast at Tiffany's party in Soho.\" |\n",
    "| **BART** | \"Olafur and Nathalie will go to Tiffany's party for New Year's Eve.\" |\n",
    "| **Gemini** | \"The group decided to go to a club in Soho for New Year's Eve, after considering opera and a 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' party. They need to buy tickets soon.\" |\n",
    "| **Kimi K2** | \"Group agrees on a 'classy' New Year's Eve: they'll buy tickets for the Breakfast-at-Tiffany's-themed party at Soho club.\" |\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how BART is concise but drops Zoe entirely. The frontier models capture more context (the opera discussion, the ticket purchase) but use more words doing so. Kimi K2 even preserves the \"classy\" requirement that was important to Nathalie.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 3 (Test ID 417 — Cancelled Meeting):**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Source | Summary |\n",
    "|--------|---------|\n",
    "| **Human** | \"Miranda can't make her meeting with Stephanie as she has to work.\" |\n",
    "| **BART** | \"Miranda has to work 20 hours a day.\" |\n",
    "| **Claude** | \"Miranda requests to cancel tomorrow's meeting due to work obligations. Stephanie agrees after Miranda explains her demanding schedule as a young doctor.\" |\n",
    "| **Kimi K2** | \"Miranda canceled tomorrow's meeting due to work; Stephanie accepted after some teasing about doctors' grueling hours.\" |\n",
    "\n",
    "Here BART misses the point entirely—focusing on the \"20 hours\" detail rather than the meeting cancellation. Claude and Kimi K2 both capture the actual outcome (meeting cancelled, Stephanie agreed) plus the interpersonal dynamic. This is a case where the frontier models genuinely outperform on *semantic accuracy* even if ROUGE doesn't reflect it.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Latency: Faster Than Expected, but Variable\n",
    "\n",
    "| Model | Mean Latency | P50 | P95 | Max |\n",
    "|-------|-------------|-----|-----|-----|\n",
    "| **Gemini 2.5 Flash** | **0.65s** | 0.62s | 0.81s | 2.65s |\n",

    "**Comparison to local models:**\n",
    "- BART (Exp 2): 0.20s mean\n",
    "- T5 (Exp 2): 0.23s mean\n",
    "- DistilBERT→GPT2 (Exp 1): 0.40s mean\n",
    "\n",
    "The fastest API model (Gemini 2.5 Flash at 0.65s) is **~3× slower** than fine-tuned BART running locally. For batch processing, this adds up quickly—summarizing 1,000 conversations takes ~11 minutes with Gemini vs ~3 minutes with local BART.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Latency observations:**\n",
    "- **Gemini 2.5 Flash** lives up to its \"Flash\" name—fastest by a wide margin\n",
    "- **Chinese models (Kimi K2, Qwen)** showed higher variance, likely due to geographic routing from US-based testing\n",
    "- **Tail latency matters:** P95 values reach 6–8s for some models, which could cause timeouts in production\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reliability: Mostly Solid, One Outlier\n",
    "\n",
    "Most models completed all 819 test examples without errors. The exception:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Qwen 2.5 72B:** 30 errors (3.7% failure rate)\n",
    "\n",
    "These failures were API timeouts or malformed responses, not content issues. Despite its low cost and strong ROUGE scores, Qwen's reliability would need monitoring in production. The US-based frontier providers (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic) had zero failures across all test examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cost Projection: The Real Math\n",
    "\n",
    "For a messaging platform at scale, let's estimate costs for summarizing 1M conversations/month:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumptions:**\n",
    "- Average dialogue: ~100 words → ~150 tokens input\n",
    "- Average summary: ~25 words → ~40 tokens output\n",
    "- 1M conversations/month\n",
    "\n",
    "| Model | Monthly Input Cost | Monthly Output Cost | **Total/Month** |\n",
    "|-------|-------------------|--------------------:|----------------:|\n",
    "| Qwen 2.5 72B | $10.50 | $10.40 | **$20.90** |\n",
    "| GPT-5 Mini | $37.50 | $80.00 | **$117.50** |\n",
    "| Gemini 2.5 Flash | $45.00 | $100.00 | **$145.00** |\n",
    "| Kimi K2 | $58.50 | $76.00 | **$134.50** |\n",
    "| Claude 4.5 Haiku | $150.00 | $200.00 | **$350.00** |\n",
    "\n",
    "**vs. Fine-tuned local model:**\n",
    "- One-time training cost: ~$10–50 in GPU time\n",
    "- Inference: Free (your own hardware)\n",
    "- Monthly cost at scale: **~$0** (just electricity)\n",
    "\n",
    "At 1M conversations/month, even the cheapest API model (Qwen) costs ~$250/year. Claude would cost ~$4,200/year. Fine-tuned BART costs essentially nothing after the initial training investment.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Real Trade-off\n",
    "\n",
    "This experiment reveals that the choice between fine-tuned local models and frontier APIs isn't primarily about quality—it's about operational trade-offs:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Factor | Fine-Tuned Local | Zero-Shot API |\n",
    "|--------|-----------------|---------------|\n",
    "| **ROUGE scores** | Higher (style-matched) | Lower (verbose) |\n",
    "| **Summary fluency** | Good | Excellent |\n",
    "| **Semantic accuracy** | Sometimes misses nuance | Often more complete |\n",
    "| **Latency** | 0.2–0.4s | 0.6–3.0s |\n",
    "| **Cost at 1M/month** | ~$0 | $21–350 |\n",
    "| **Privacy** | Data stays local | Data leaves infra |\n",
    "| **Setup effort** | Hours of training | Minutes of prompting |\n",
    "| **Customization** | Full control | Prompt engineering only |\n",
    "| **Reliability** | Deterministic | Provider-dependent |\n",
    "\n",
    "For a quick prototype or low-volume use case, API models are the obvious choice—especially Qwen at $0.07/M input. For production at scale with specific style requirements, fine-tuning wins decisively.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's Next\n",
    "\n",
    "The final comparison notebook will:\n",
    "- Consolidate all ROUGE and latency metrics into unified tables\n",
    "- Analyze error patterns across all three experiments\n",
    "- Discuss deployment trade-offs in more depth\n",
    "- Provide final recommendations for the \"Acme Communications\" use case\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, the key insight is clear: **fine-tuning matters for metrics, but zero-shot models aren't wrong—they're just different.** Even relatively small models (BART at 139M parameters, T5 at 60M) can outperform frontier giants on ROUGE when properly trained. But as the qualitative examples show, ROUGE doesn't tell the whole story. Sometimes the verbose, context-rich frontier summary is actually *better*—it just doesn't match the reference annotator's style.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"just use GPT\" approach is convenient, but it's not a free lunch—and for this task, the lunch you get depends heavily on how you measure \"good.\"\n"
